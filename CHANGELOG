* Enhancements

  * Stop requiring blockenspiel - instance_eval is enough
  * Switch to minitest and minitest-reporters
  * Test on MRI 1.8, MRI 1.9, and JRuby 1.6.7+

* Bug fixes

  * Make sure Curation derives its hash code (#hash) directly from its value
  * Fix test for setting `false` characteristic
  * Don't try keys.sort on hashes with symbol keys in 1.8 (it blows up)... anyway keys.to_set is way faster
